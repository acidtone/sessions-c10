            ## Transitions and Animations

            ---

            ## 12 Principles of Animation
            1. Squash and Stretch
            2. Anticipation
            3. Staging
            4. Straight Ahead Action and Pose-to-Pose
            5. **Follow Through and Overlapping Action**
            6. Ease In, Ease Out
            7. Arcs
            8. **Secondary Action**
            9. **Timing and Spacing**
            10. Exaggeration
            11. Solid Drawing
            12. Appeal


            ---

            ### Animation Principle
            ## Timing and Spacing
            - Makes animated objects appear to obey the laws of physics
            - Establishes mood, emotion and reaction

            ---

            ## Timing = duration
            ## Spacing = easing

            ---

            ## CSS Easing Keywords
            - `linear`
            - `ease`
            - `ease-in`
            - `ease-out`
            - `ease-in-out`

            But [cubic bezier curves](https://cubic-bezier.com/) make everything better.

            ---

            ### Animation Principle
            ## Follow Through
            - Not everything comes to a stop at once
            - Overshooting the target position

            ---

            ### Animation Principle
            ## Secondary Action
            - Provides supplementary action
            - Reinforces and adds dimension
            - Often exaggerates the action

            ---

            ## Tips and tricks
            - Similar objects should animate in similar ways
            - Entrance should inform exit
                - Objects should leave the way they came in
            - Match velocities

            ---

            ## Activity
            ### What can you animate?
            Using this [Starter Code](https://codepen.io/acidtone/pen/GRwRowz), try animating one or more of the following properties:
            - `opacity`
            - `width`
            - `height`
            - `position: absolute`
                - `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`
            - `transform: rotate()`

            Or use your imagination!

            ## Live Code Challenge
            ### Sliding Hamburger Menu
            Using this [Starter Code](https://codepen.io/acidtone/pen/ZEmEWzK) try the following:
            1. Have the menu slide in from the side with purpose and style
            2. Replace the Menu button with this [animated hamburger icon](https://codepen.io/acidtone/pen/RwpEMxV)

            ## CSS Transitions vs Animations

            ---

            ### CSS Transitions
            - Need to be triggered.
            - Can't be looped.
            - The `transition` property can only animate from one value to another.
            - Are very Javascript-friendly (consider using CSS Variables).
            - Are hardware accelerated (i.e. they're faster)

            ---

            ### CSS Animations
            - Don't need to triggered; they can just happen.
            - Are totally okay being looped.
            - `@keyframes` provide much more control and complexity than Transitions.
            - Are not very Javascript-friendly.
            - Can hurt page performance.

            ---

            ## Which One to Choose?
            Go with a **CSS Transition** if:
            - You need a from/to animation that is triggered by the user.
            - You want to manipulate property values with JS.

            Go with a **CSS Animation** if:
            - It needs to be looped.
            - You want it to start on page load.
            - You need an effect that Transitions can't do. 

            ---

            ### When in doubt, use a CSS Transition

            ---

            ## What can't be animated
            - `display` modes
            - `visibility`
            - `linear-gradient` and `radial-gradient`
            - Any other properties that have discreet on/off behaviour

            A common use case: use `opacity` for hiding/showing elements instead of `display:none`
            ```css
            div {
              transition: opacity .25s
            }
            div.hidden {
              opacity: 0;
            }
            ```
