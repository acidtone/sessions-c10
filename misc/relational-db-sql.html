            ---

            ## Terminology
            <dl>
              <dt>Relational Database</dt>
              <dd>Data organized into one or more tables of columns and rows, with a unique key identifying each row.</dd>
              <dt>Relation</dt>
              <dd>A relationship between two columns in one or more tables. Relations can be one-to-one, one-to-many or many-to-many.</dd>
              <dt>SQL</dt>
              <dd>Structured query language (SQL) is a standard language for database creation and manipulation.</dd>
            </dl>

            ---

            ## Data Strategy 
            ### For Beginners
            Great for intro sessions with your client/product owner:
            1. List all the "**things**" (objects, nouns, entities) that you need to store.
            2. For each thing, list all the **attributes** that describe the thing.
            3. Decide how each thing is **related** to each other.
            4. Do a **CRUD analysis** of each thing. How will each thing be created, retrieved, edited and deleted from a software and business perspective?

            ---
            
            ## Naming conventions
            Table and Column names should:
            - be lowercase
            - use underscores instead of spaces
            - be singular instead of plural
            - not begin with a number

            ---

            ## Relational Databases
            ### Fancy Google Sheets

            ---

            ### Sheet names &rarr; Entities (tables)
            ![Sheet names are entities](../assets/images/db/table-names.png)
            
            Entities (table names) are the nouns that are described by the columns in a table.

            ---

            ### Columns &rarr; Attributes
            ![Google Sheet column](../assets/images/db/columns.png)
            
            Attributes describe the individual aspects of a particular Entity and are usually just called columns.
            
            ---

            ### Rows &rarr; Records
            ![Google Sheet row](../assets/images/db/rows.png)
            
            Records are the actual data that are described by the data in each column. These are often called rows.

            ---

            ### Cell Format &rarr; Data Type
            ![Google Sheet cell format menu](../assets/images/db/data-types.png)

            Every column has a data type defined when it's created.

            ---

            ## Constraints
            ### Added for data integrity

            ---

            ### Primary Key
            ![id column in a Google Sheet](../assets/images/db/primary-key.png)

            **Primary keys** uniquely identify each Record in a Table. By convention, the primary key of a table is named **`id`**.

            ---

            ### Compound Primary Key
            ![Two id columns in a table](../assets/images/db/compound-primary-key.png)

            A **Compound Primary Key** uniquely defines a table row with a combination of two primary/foreign keys.

            By convention, these tables are named by the two joining table names, separated by an underscore.

            ---

            ### Foreign Key
            ![Google Sheet columns containing other table ids](../assets/images/db/foreign-key.png)

            **Foreign keys** create a column relationship between two tables. 
            
            By convention, column names with foreign key relationships end in **`_id`**.

            ---

            ### Check Constraints
            When a column has a limited range of allowed values.

            ### Not NULL
            When a column cannot be empty.

            ### Unique
            When each value in a table column must be unique.

            ### Default
            When a default column value is defined if one is not provided when a row is created or updated.

            ---

            ## Relations
            ### Types of Foreign Key Relationships

            ---


            ### One-to-Many
            ![one-to-one diagram](../assets/images/db/one-to-many.png)

            _Entity A_ belongs to one _Entity B_ but _Entity B_ can belong to many _Entity A_.

            **Example**: A country can have many cities but a city can only be in one country.

            ---

            ### Many-to-Many
            ![one-to-one diagram](../assets/images/db/many-to-many.png)

            _Entity A_ belongs to many _Entity B_ and vice versa.

            **Example**: A movie can have many actors and an actor can be in many movies.
            
            ---

            ### One-to-one (rare)
            ![one-to-one diagram](../assets/images/db/one-to-one.png)

            One-to-one relationships are rare but are sometimes used in more advanced "super/subtype" data model architectures.

            ---

            ## SQL
            ### Structured Query Language

            ---

            ### Common SQL Commands
            The most common SQL statements follow traditional CRUD Operations:
            
            Create &rarr; `INSERT`

            Retrieve &rarr; `SELECT`

            Update &rarr; `UPDATE`

            Delete &rarr; `DELETE`

            ---

            ### Create &rarr; `INSERT INTO`
            Insert data into all columns of a table:
            ```sql
            INSERT INTO 
              table_name
            VALUES 
              (value1, value2, value3, ...); 
            ```

            ### Example
            Insert data into specific columns of a table:
            ```sql
            INSERT INTO 
              table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...)
            VALUES 
              (value1, value2, value3, ...);  
            ```

            ---

            ### Retrieve &rarr; `SELECT`
            Select specific columns from all rows from a table:
            ```sql
            SELECT 
              column1, column2, ...
            FROM 
              table_name; 
            ```

            ### Examples
            
            SELECT first_name, last_name FROM customer
            ```sql
            SELECT first_name, last_name FROM customer;
            ```

            SELECT all columns FROM customer with `*`:
            ```sql
            SELECT * FROM customer;
            ```

            ---

            ### `SELECT` with `WHERE`
            Select from specific rows with WHERE
            ```sql
            SELECT 
              column1, column2, ...
            FROM 
              table_name 
            WHERE
              condition;
            ```

            ### Example
            Find all fields for anyone with a last name of 'Packe':
            ```sql
            SELECT * FROM customer WHERE last_name = 'Packe';
            ```
            ---

            ### `SELECT` with `ORDER BY`
            Order the rows returned with ORDER BY:
            ```sql
            SELECT 
              column1, column2, ...
            FROM 
              table_name 
            WHERE
              condition;
            ORDER BY
              column1, column2 ASC|DESC
            ```

            ### Example
            Find all customers by last name, starting at Z:
            ```sql
            SELECT id, first_name, last_name FROM customer ORDER BY last_name DESC
            ```

            ---

            ### Update &rarr; `UPDATE`
            Update a row using `SET` and `WHERE`:
            ```sql
            UPDATE 
              table_name
            SET 
              column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
            WHERE 
              condition; 
            ```

            ### Example
            Update the last name of customer `4` to "Marcias":
            ```sql
            UPDATE customer SET last_name = 'Marcias' WHERE id = '4' 
            ```

            ---

            ### Delete &rarr; `DELETE`
            Delete rows with `WHERE` (we rarely delete rows in production):
            ```sql
            DELETE FROM 
              table_name 
            WHERE 
              condition; 
            ```

            ### Example
            Delete all records that total more than 1000 (then get fired):

            ```sql
            DELETE FROM rental_invoice WHERE total_amount_payable > 1000; 
            ```
