            ## Contracting as a Developer
            ### Tony's unofficial advice

            ---

            ### Part 1
            ## The Contractor Mindset

            ---

            ## Work on Your Craft
            ### Your education is your responsibility

            ---

            ## Expand Your Craft
            ### Go to where the work is

            ---

            ## Find a Mentor(s)
            ### (And Don't Waste Their Time)

            ---

            ## Have a Backup Job
            ### Contracting is "Feast or Famine"

            ---

            ## Have a Backup Team
            ### Contracting is "Feast or Famine"

            ---

            ### Part 2
            ## Finding clients and projects

            ---

            ### 1. Friends, family, colleagues
            Your first client will most likely be someone you already know.

            - Tony's first (volunteer) project: [His Step-mom's website](http://clairescott.com/).

            Volunteer work is fine if:
            - You like the client/project
            - You need more work for your portfolio
            - You're learning a new skill

            ---

            ### 2. Job boards
            See the [Pixels Job Board](https://pixelsyyc.com/)
            - Many job postings are part-time contract
            - Don't limit yourself to "full-stack"
            - Don't limit yourself to Calgary
            
            Tony's first paying gig: [PPDM](https://ppdm.org/) in 2000
            - Applied through the U of C Job Board
            - Client for over 10 years
            - Starting rate: $16/hour (in 2000)
            
            ---
            
            ### 3. Word-of-mouth
            Tony's best, biggest clients came from referrals:
            - [CAPLA](https://caplacanada.org/)
            - [CAPL](https://www.landman.ca/) (now CALEP)
            - [IRWA](https://www.irwaonline.org/)
            - [PODS](https://pods.org/)
            
            Most were decades-long relationships with oil and gas trade organizations that came from PPDM.

            ---
            
            ### 4. Networking
            - Meet strangers anyway you can
            - Don't limit yourself to "networking events"
            - Don't limit yourself to the "tech industry"
            - Revisit previous co-workers, colleagues, acquaintances
            - Embrace serendipity

            ---

            ### Part 3
            ## Expectation Management

            ---

            ## Under-promise and over-perform
            ### [Be like Scotty](https://youtu.be/L3jXhmr_o9A?t=40)

            ---
            
            ## Be an Educator
            ### Developers are like Mechanics
            Often the client doesn't know what they're buying and why it costs so much.

            ---

            ## Learn to Say No
            ### Scope creep is profitable but...
            - It's not a great way to spend your time
            - It's often not in the clients' best interest
            - It leads to buggy software

            ---

            ## Document All Client Interactions
            - Take minutes during all meetings 
              - Agenda
              - Actions
              - General Notes
            - Email phone call summaries directly after the call
            - Move action items from minutes/summaries to your task manager after every interaction

            ---

            ## Client Red Flags
            ### Go with your gut
            - Late payment! Unless they're a big corp.
            - Gatekeepers!
            - Abdication: the delegation of responsibility.
            - Chronic drama, blame games, etc.
            - Beware of startup founders who are too in love with their ideas.

            Ignored advice is not necessarily bad unless you get blamed afterwards.

            ---

            ### Part 4
            ## Getting Paid

            ---

            ### Important
            ## Talk to a Lawyer
            - Tony's not a lawyer. Don't trust anything he says.
            - Tony uses [Good Lawyer](https://www.goodlawyer.ca/) for contract reviews and consultations.

            ---

            ### Important
            ## Hire an Accountant
            - Tony has never done his own taxes
            - You'd be surprised what you can (and can't) write-off
            - Do your own bookkeeping to save money

            ---

            ### Important
            ## It's not your money!
            Money you receive by invoice isn't all yours.
            - You still have to pay tax on that income, minus write-offs
            - You have to pay back any GST you charged on your invoices
            - Tony's recommendation: Set aside about 1/3rd of all invoice income just to be safe 

            ---

            ## Signing the client
            Every scenario is different but most have the following steps:
            1. **First Contact**: First-time meeting
            2. **Romance**: Is it the right fit? Includes free advice.
            3. **Non-disclosure Agreement**: Often required for deeper discussions (can be Step 1 or 2) 
                - [Sample NDA](../files/NDA.pdf) (have this vetted by a lawyer)
            4. **"Sign" the client** - can often be just an email but can also include Statement of Work, Project Proposal/Charter, etc.
            5. **Discovery**: What have you gotten yourself into?

            ---

            ### How are you getting paid?
            1. Time and materials (by the hour)
                - Tony recommends this for beginners
            2. Fixed quote with installments
            3. Retainer
            4. Product

            ---

            ### 1. Time and materials
            - Client is charged by the hour
            - Track time in 15 increments
            - Invoice monthly (or every two weeks)
            - **Cannot** charge for invoicing, learning, screw-ups
            - Use invoicing/time tracking software. Tony uses [Freshbooks](https://www.freshbooks.com/) (it's pricey but there are many alternatives)

            ---

            ### Included on all of Tony's "contracts"
            > "This is not a fixed quote. Invoices will be sent monthly based on time worked. A monthly time quota is available upon request."

            ---

            ### 2. Fixed quote with installments
            - Not well suited to agile projects
            - Requires a lot of documentation
            - Ask for at least 25% up front
            - Schedule installments when phases are "complete"
            - Weigh the installments so you're at least 75% paid by the time the website/app is ready for launch
            
            ---

            ### 3. Retainer
            - Paid up-front for a set amount of hours
            - Not well suited for development 
            - Great for regular content updates and maintenance

            ---

            ### 4. Product
            - Paying a set price for a defined product or set of features
            - Examples
              - Software packages (i.e 5-page Wix website)
              - Software as a service
              - Client training packages

            ---

            ### The Big Question
            ## What's your rate?
            
            ---

            ## Sole proprietorships
            You don't have to incorporate to operate under a business name:
            1. Register a [NUANS](https://www.nuans.com/site/nuans-corporate-name-trademark-reports/en) tradename at a Registry
            2. Open a business bank account with tradename
            3. Give the tradename registration to your accountant when making a Statement of Business Income on your taxes

            ## Questions to ask the client
            ### (Not an exhaustive list)

            ---

            ### Is this a new or existing project?
            - What's the history of the project?
            - What's the purpose of the project?
            - Who are the Stakeholders?

            ---

            ### Existing (Legacy) Projects

            ---

            ### Who is currently working on the project?
            - Who originally developed it?
            - Are they still there? Is there drama?
            - Who is the project lead?

            ---

            ### What do they need? Where do you fit in?
            - Be honest with your skills but...
            - Don't sell yourself short
            - Do you know any colleagues/mentors that can help?

            ---

            ### Where is the Production server hosted?
            - Are they using a password manager?
                - If not, recommend a password manager?
            - What credentials are needed to access the website?
                - Web server
                - Git repos
                - Database server
                - etc

            ---

            ### Does the client have Analytics installed?
            - Get access to the Google Analytics
            - Use the Content Drilldown to learn which site content is most popular.
            - What is the Audience
              - What percentage is mobile traffic?
              - What is the browser share?

            ---

            ### New (Greenfield) Projects

            ---

            ### Is the site replacing a legacy site? If yes:
            - Is there a database?
            - How many users are there? How much traffic?
            - Are there any hard deadlines?
            - Is the host changing?

            ---

            ### Where is the Production site going to be hosted?
            - **Hosted**: i.e. with Media Temple, Hostgator, AWS, Azure, etc
              - make sure host has good support
            - **On-premise** (rare): hosted on site with the client
              - only allow this if the client has an IT department (could be one person)
        
            ---

            ### Where is the Staging (development) server going to be hosted?
            - Does the current host have cheap/free staging servers available (preferred)?
            - If the servers are different, when how will the site be migrated?
            - Who's credit card will be on the account?
                - Client pays directly?
                - Developer expenses to client?
